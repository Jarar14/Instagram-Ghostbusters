# Instagram-Ghostbusters

Analyzing like & follow data from Instagram, from ghosts (non-interactive followers) to biggest fans

___________
INSTRUCTIONS

In this pre-webscraping version, user must copy-paste follower and like data directly from Instagram into txt files

Go to your instagram page, and one by one copy your Followers page, and the likes of whichever posts you want to pull data from.
Copy profile pictures too, as that is what the usernames are pulled from for reliability
-Paste list of your followers into "FollowerPage.txt"
-Paste list of all likers on selected posts into "LikesPage.txt". Choose as many posts as you wish, paste one after another

Run app, and then open "Final Stats.txt" to find a list of all accounts that have liked your photos and frequency of likes,
in ascending order of likes
List includes your followers too, so you can find ghosts, followers that don't interact with your page (boo!)

DISCLAIMERS & FUTURE PLANS

I am not associated with Instagram or their products, I just wish to understand the data provided to me on my own page

In this pre-webscraping version, user must copy-paste follower and like data directly from Instagram into txt files. Web-scraping for
automatic data-collection in the works
